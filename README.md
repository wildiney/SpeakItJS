This is a personal project made to help my daughter learn how to spell and read.

The first version was made only with vanilla javascript and html. I've read recently about next.js and remake this simple project just to test.

## Install

Just run

```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

## Demo

Demo is available in [https://wil-speakit.netlify.app/](https://wil-speakit.netlify.app/)
